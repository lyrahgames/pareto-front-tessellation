      This images shows a three-dimensional domain constructed by three uniform ball distributions and its triangulated Pareto frontier.
      First, the Pareto frontier has been projected onto the two-dimensional hyperplane with normal $n=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$.
      Then the Delaunay algorithm was used to generate the triangulation.

      First, the Pareto frontier has been projected onto the two-dimensional hyperplane with normal $n=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$.
      Then the Delaunay algorithm was used to generate the triangulation.
      At the end, the statistical heuristic removed connections with large distances to dispose of incontinuities.
